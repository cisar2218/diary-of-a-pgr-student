# Diary of a PGR student
## What it is
My walkthrought of the university subject computer graphic. Main challenges are the semestral project (opengl) and the final exam.
## Motivation
I am not very interested in computer graphic, that's why I created this repozitory. I usualy use private repository to backup my school project. This subject is special for me because it's boring and hard in the same time for me. I want to point out that teacher is very good. It's my personal choice to don't like computer graphics staff. :D What makes this walkthrought special is also that if I don't make it I will drop the school (by rules of university).
1. Make notes.
2. By explanation I will make sure that I understand the topic completely.
3. Can potentialy help others in future.
4. What is public usualy makes pressure for perfection.
