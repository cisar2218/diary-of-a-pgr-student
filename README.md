# Diary of a PGR student
## What it is
My walkthrought of the university subject computer graphic. Main challenges are the semestral project (opengl) and the final exam.
## Motivation
I am not very interested in computer graphic, that's why I created this repozitory. I usualy use private repository to backup my school project. This subject is special for me because it's boring and hard in the same time for me. I want to point out that teacher is very good. It's my personal choice to don't like computer graphics staff. :D What makes this walkthrought special is also that if I don't make it I will drop the school (by rules of university).
1. Make notes.
2. By explanation I will make sure that I understand the topic completely.
3. Can potentialy help others in future.
4. What is public usualy makes pressure for perfection.

### 1) Hello World
This is just simple hello word which draws single triagle. Main purpose is that many small things have to be adjusted before projects can run. These tweaks can be found [here](https://cent.felk.cvut.cz/courses/PGR/). But in general this configuration is specific (yours will be different).
